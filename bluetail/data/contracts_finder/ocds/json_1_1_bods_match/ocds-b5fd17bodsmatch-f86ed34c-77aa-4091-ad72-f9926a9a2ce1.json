        "description": "Arc has established a framework agreement for the supply of Building Works and Services. Applications were invited from experienced providers of construction (building) works and services who can provide high quality works and services using a customer focused approach particularly in the public sector. It is anticipated that the works and services will be provided by the providers themselves and/or through their supply chain. Consortia bids were accepted, in the case of group companies only one bid will be accepted from either the group company or one of subsidiaries, but not both. The specific works and services that may be procured under the Framework cannot be clearly defined at this stage, however the nature and types of works that may be required may include those services identified by CPV code on or in connection with any land or property and related asset owned, rented, leased or developed by the public sector body eligible to use the Framework.",
