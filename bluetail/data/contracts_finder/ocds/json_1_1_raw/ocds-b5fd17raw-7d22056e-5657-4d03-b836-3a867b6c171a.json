        "description": "An estimated further 130 households that are private owner occupied and privately rented in rural areas of Herefordshire and Shropshire are set to benefit from the Rural Warm Homes Fund project to install efficient affordable first time heating. The funding established by National Grid and being administered by Community Interest Company, Affordable Warmth Solutions, is designed to support councils, registered social landlords and relevant partner organisations to address some of the issues affecting fuel poor households. There is no defined list of properties as these will emerge through the project facilitated by the contract administrators. Installers will also be able to inform the Contract Administrator of qualifying properties. Funding will be combined with other non-council funding streams (principally ECO3) to provide &pound;0.96 million of capital works to an estimated 150 eligible households across Herefordshire and Shropshire. This funding refers to Category 2: Rural (Renewables including Biomass, Heat pumps and LPG installs) with targets of 150.\r\nContractors can bid to deliver against just the LPG installs, Biomass installs, or just the heat pump installs, or all. \r\n\r\nLot 1: LPG (estimated installation of 110)\r\n\r\nLot 2: Air Source Heat Pumps (estimated installation of 10 - 20)\r\n\r\nLot 3: Ground Source Heat Pumps (estimated installation of 10 - 20)\r\n\r\nLot 4: Biomass (estimated installation of 10 - 20)\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                          Herefordshire Council has published this opportunity on the &#039;Supplying the Southwest Portal&#039;.
