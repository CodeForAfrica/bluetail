Leicester City Council have awarded Framework Agreements to the successful community pharmacies located in specific wards of Leicester City where young people seem to prefer to access pharmacies in close proximity to the City Centre and the two Universities.  The proposed Framework Agreement will be for a period of 4 years (48 months) to commence on 1st April 2019 until 31st March 2023. The proposed service is based on current and known funding allocations. These could alter through the life of the contract due to changes in future local and central government funding. The contract value assigned to this service is estimated to be &pound;60,000.00 per annum, estimated to be &pound;240,000.00 for the full 48 months of the Framework Agreement period.  Tenderers should note that this value has been estimated using the current spend on the service provision already in place. This is no guarantee of future volumes or value of business. Throughout the duration of the Framework, the Authority may at its discretion review the Framework and may open the Framework at its own discretion when a service need arises. A service need includes (but is not limited to): a) a lack of capacity from current providers and therefore there is a need to supplement the framework list of providers beyond the numbers initially appointed to the contract; b) an increase in the volume of service users requiring the services under the Framework; and c) to replace (if required) providers who have been removed, suspended from the framework or did not agree to provide the services. Opening the Framework will allow the opportunity for any potential new providers who are not currently appointed to the Framework to apply to the Authority, when the new tender opportunity is advertised, to be so appointed for the remainder of the term of the contract.", "supplyChain": false, "hasEnquiries": null, "tenderPeriod": {"endDate": "2019-03-08T00:00:00Z"}, "awardCriteria": null, "submissionMethod": null, "xClassifications": {"isSuitableForSme": false, "isSuitableForVco": false, "ojeuContractType": "Services"}, "procurementMethod": null, "eligibilityCriteria": null, "awardCriteriaDetails": null, "submissionMethodDetails": null, "procurementMethodDetails": "Open procedure", "procurementMethodRationale": "", "numberOfTenderers": 1, "tenderers": [{"id": "2", "name": "Boots UK ltd"}], "contractPeriod": {"startDate": "2019-07-01T00:00:00Z", "endDate": "2023-03-31T00:00:00Z"}}, "parties": [{"id": "0a5e6c4b80218e0123618aaaa651b02a", "name": "Leicester City Council", "roles": ["buyer"], "address": {"region": null, "locality": "Leicester", "postalCode": "LE1 6TH", "countryName": "England", "streetAddress": "Bosworth House 9-15 Princess Road West"}, "contactPoint": {"uri": "http://www.leicester.gov.uk", "name": "Bharat Mistry", "email": "procurement-asc@leicester.gov.uk", "faxNumber": null, "telephone": "+44 1164542359"}}, {"id": "0", "sme": false, "vco": false, "name": "Bestway National Chemists Limited &amp; Bestway Panacea Healthca", "roles": ["tenderer"], "address": {"region": "", "locality": "", "postalCode": "", "countryName": "", "streetAddress": "Merchants Warehouse, 21 Castle Street, Manchester, M3 4LZ"}, "identifier": {"id": "", "uri": null, "scheme": "", "legalName": null}, "contactPoint": {"name": "", "email": "", "faxNumber": "", "telephone": ""}, "x_awardValue": {"amount": null, "currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "2", "sme": false, "vco": false, "name": "Boots UK ltd", "roles": ["tenderer"], "address": {"region": "", "locality": "", "postalCode": "", "countryName": "", "streetAddress": "NHS Contracts and Tenders, Boots Support Office, D90 EF07, Thane Road, Beeston, Nottingham, NG90 1BS"}, "identifier": {"id": "00928555", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "BOOTS UK LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {"name": "", "email": "", "faxNumber": "", "telephone": ""}, "x_awardValue": {"amount": null, "currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "2", "sme": true, "vco": false, "name": "Leicestershire Independent Pharmacy Company Limited", "roles": ["tenderer"], "address": {"region": "", "locality": "", "postalCode": "", "countryName": "", "streetAddress": "Pickford House, 18-20 High View Close, Leicester, LE4 9LJ"}, "identifier": {"id": "", "uri": null, "scheme": "", "legalName": null}, "contactPoint": {"name": "", "email": "", "faxNumber": "", "telephone": ""}, "x_awardValue": {"amount": null, "currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "3", "sme": true, "vco": false, "name": "Morningside Pharmacy Contracts", "roles": ["tenderer"], "address": {"region": "", "locality": "", "postalCode": "", "countryName": "", "streetAddress": "Unit C, Harcourt Way, Meridian business Park, Leicester, LE19 1WP"}, "identifier": {"id": "", "uri": null, "scheme": "", "legalName": null}, "contactPoint": {"name": "", "email": "", "faxNumber": "", "telephone": ""}, "x_awardValue": {"amount": null, "currency": "GBP"}}], "language": "en-GB", "initiationType": "tender"}], "publisher": {"uid": null, "uri": "https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk", "name": "DUE NORTH LIMITED", "scheme": "GB-GOVUK-crown_comercial_service"}, "extensions": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/ocds_process_title_extension/v1.1/extension.json"], "publishedDate": "2019-06-25T11:42:24Z", "publicationPolicy": "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-contracting"}
