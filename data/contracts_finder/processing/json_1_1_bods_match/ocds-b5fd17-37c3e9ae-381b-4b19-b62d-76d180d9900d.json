The framework also includes alternative technology platforms for managing the customers&#039; recruitment processes.\r\n\r\nESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete &amp; return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.\r\n\r\nLot 1: Managed Service Provision - Service provision where one Managed Service Provider takes responsibility for delivering recruitment services on behalf of the Customer, as an alternative to the Customer managing a framework of individual Agencies. Managed Services can often involve the Managed Service Provider operating a &#039;tiered&#039; structure of Agencies to deliver the Services, dependent on the service model provided.\r\n\r\nLot 2: Vendor Management System - For Customers who are looking for a technology solution to help them manage recruitment Agencies, either on a self-service basis where recruitment is devolved to Hiring Managers, or via their own internal recruitment team. The system used will help Customers to manage their supply chain, and interact with Agencies &amp; Temporary Agency Workers through the system in regards to ordering, timesheet reconciliation, compliance &amp; management information\r\n\r\nLot 3: Talent Pool Technology - For Customers who are looking for a Talent Pool Technology Platform that they can contract with directly and either include within their existing MSP delivery model or develop as a stand-alone solution. A Talent Pool Technology Platform is an online database which allows a Worker to register, create, maintain &amp; delete their own profile and be matched automatically to jobs put forward through the platform by Hiring Managers. The Talent Pool Technology Platform will be available via desktop and/or app. As such, Tenders will only be accepted for Lot 3 from Tenderers who fulfil the Talent Pool Technology Core Specification. Tenderers for Lot 3 Talent Pool Technology will own the intellectual property rights (IPR) and development of the platform.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period. An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nTo tender: (a) Go to www.eastmidstenders.org, (b) Register (c) Search for tender opportunity &#039;653F_19&#039; d) Express an interest (e) Download the tender from the website.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the closing date for submission of tenders is 12:00 midday 20/11/2018", "tenderPeriod": {"endDate": "2018-12-20T00:00:00Z"}, "xClassifications": {"isSuitableForSme": true, "isSuitableForVco": true, "ojeuContractType": "Services"}, "procurementMethodDetails": "Open procedure", "numberOfTenderers": 8, "tenderers": [{"id": "2", "name": "Matrix SCM Limited"}, {"id": "6", "name": "SAP (UK) Limited"}, {"id": "7", "name": "Morgan Hunt UK Limited"}, {"id": "8", "name": "Capita Business Services Ltd"}, {"id": "12", "name": "Randstad Solutions Limited"}, {"id": "16", "name": "Pertemps Recruitment Partnership Limited"}, {"id": "21", "name": "Comensura Ltd"}, {"id": "22", "name": "Reed Specialist Recruitment Ltd"}], "contractPeriod": {"startDate": "2019-04-11T00:00:00Z", "endDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z"}}, "parties": [{"id": "e1eca6b070a5173cfc22a641552ceee7", "name": "ESPO", "roles": ["buyer"], "address": {"locality": "Leicester", "postalCode": "LE19 1ES", "countryName": "England", "streetAddress": "Barnsdale Way, Grove Park Enderby"}, "contactPoint": {"uri": "http://www.espo.org/", "name": "Mr David Maylin", "email": "tenders@espo.org", "telephone": "+44 1162944005"}}, {"id": "2", "sme": true, "name": "Matrix SCM Limited", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "Partis House, Davy Avenue, Knowlhill, Milton Keynes, MK5 8HJ"}, "identifier": {"id": "02227962", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "MATRIX SCM LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "6", "name": "SAP (UK) Limited", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "Clockhouse Place, Feltham, TW14 8HD"}, "identifier": {"id": "02152073", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "SAP (UK) LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "7", "sme": true, "name": "Morgan Hunt UK Limited", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "9th Floor, 125 London Wall, London, EC2Y 5AS"}, "identifier": {"id": "04349535", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "MORGAN HUNT UK LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "8", "name": "Capita Business Services Ltd", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "The Copyright Building, 30 Berners Street, London, W1T 3LR"}, "identifier": {"id": "02299747", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "CAPITA BUSINESS SERVICES LTD"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "12", "name": "Randstad Solutions Limited", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "450 Capability Green, Luton, Bedfordshire, LU1 3LU"}, "identifier": {"id": "02389033", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "RANDSTAD SOLUTIONS LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "16", "name": "Pertemps Recruitment Partnership Limited", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "Meriden Hall, Main Road, Meriden, Warwickshire, CV7 7PT"}, "identifier": {"id": "01644241", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "PERTEMPS RECRUITMENT PARTNERSHIP LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "21", "sme": true, "name": "Comensura Ltd", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "800 The Boulevard, Capability Green, Luton, LU1 3BA"}, "identifier": {"id": "04085767", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "COMENSURA LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}, {"id": "22", "name": "Reed Specialist Recruitment Ltd", "roles": ["supplier", "tenderer"], "address": {"streetAddress": "Academy Court, 94 Chancery Lane, London, WC2A 1DT"}, "identifier": {"id": "06903140", "scheme": "GB-COH", "legalName": "REED SPECIALIST RECRUITMENT LIMITED"}, "contactPoint": {}, "x_awardValue": {"currency": "GBP"}}], "language": "en-GB", "initiationType": "tender"}], "publisher": {"uri": "https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk", "name": "DUE NORTH LIMITED", "scheme": "GB-GOVUK-crown_comercial_service"}, "extensions": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/ocds_process_title_extension/v1.1/extension.json"], "publishedDate": "2019-04-15T10:17:01Z", "publicationPolicy": "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-contracting"}
