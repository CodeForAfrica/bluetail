        "description": "Re:allies Works Ltd (Re:allies) is a social housing regeneration consortia. Its membership consists of regional housing consortia who bring together unmatched experience in procurement and regeneration. The membership currently consists of Procure Plus (PP), Efficiency North (EN) and Central Housing Consortium (CHIC). Further information can be found by visiting www.re-allies.com.\r\n\r\nRe:allies wishes to procure and enter into a framework agreement with multiple suppliers for the supply of ground source heat pumps. The scope of the framework agreement will cover ground source heat pumps up to 14kW and over 14kW. The companies who are appointed to the framework agreement must be the company who would enter into an underlying contract with the customer for all aspects of the supply.\r\n\r\nThe framework will operate in conjunction with a framework agreement for the design and installation of ground source heat pump systems, which is subject to a separate procurement. The suppliers who are appointed to the framework agreement for the supply of ground source heat pumps will be required to interact with and (where required) supply materials to the contractors who are appointed to the framework agreement for the design and installation of ground source heat pump systems.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement will allow the contracting authorities named and referred to within the contract notice to enter into underlying contracts for the supply of the products covered by the framework agreement. The framework agreement is divided into two Lots and the details are as follows \u2013 \r\n1. Ground Source Heat Pumps up to 14kW\r\nPredominantly in the North West. This may extend to other areas of the UK.\r\n\r\n2. Ground Source Heat Pumps over 14kW\r\nPredominantly in the North West. This may extend to other areas of the UK.\r\n\r\nBidders are permitted to submit a tender for one or both Lots.\r\n\r\nRe:allies will be hosting a Bidders Day on the 24th October 2016 from 1pm until 3pm. The event will be held at Manchester United Football Club, Sir Matt Busby Way, Stretford, M16 0RA. The purpose of the event is to give an overview of the opportunity and the procurement process. It will be an opportunity for the Bidders to meet the Re:allies team. Registration instructions are located within the invitation to tender.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement will be in place for a period of 48 months and will not be extended beyond this term. Contracts that are called off under the framework may continue beyond the 48 month term of the framework agreement.\r\n\r\nIndividual contracting authorities entitled to access the framework agreement are listed in the Contract Notice. The contracting authorities referred to in the Contract Notice shall be under no obligation to use the framework agreement.",
